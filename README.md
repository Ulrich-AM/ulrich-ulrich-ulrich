## Readme
I will upload all of my websites and projects on here for fun, maybe until i run out of available uploads for sites.
No need to read the license, you are allowed to copy and distribute whatever i put on here, it doesn't really matter!
Fn+F12 all you want all over the site, look at the files, copy the files, heck, even upload your own website containing
all of the stuff i put here as your own! okay, maybe don't do that, but still. 
You can use this site as a reference or base for your own projects, just don't attempt to sell the crappy content on here.
